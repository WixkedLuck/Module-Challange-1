# Module-Challange-1
## This is challenge one for UoM On-the-job Ticket
For this challenge I was given starter code and was given the task of refactoring it to have better accessibility 
options. The website Horiseon is deployed to help with search engine optimization and other online management tools.
When you visit this site, a user can see what Horiseon has to offer to them and their company needs. 

-The motivation behind this project was to simulate an on-the-job scenario.

-I built this project to become more familiar with a common on-the-job scenario that junior web developers encounter - modification of starter code. 
Furthermore,  I wanted to practice improving the general accessibility of a website whilst making the code more efficient without altering its function; 
another common request for junior web developers.

-This project resolves otherwise inaccessible websites by meeting accessibility standards by providing alternative text to images and utilizing
semantic HTML elements to standardize layouts for screen-reading capabilities.

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on the process of deploying a site to GitHub and clone repositories 
while furthering my understanding of HTML and CSS.
